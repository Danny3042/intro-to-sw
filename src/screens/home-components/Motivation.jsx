          you might want a high-paying tech job. <br />
          maybe work at your own schedule. <br /> <br />
          all it takes is to make a solid start in coding. <br />
          you may have tried it before and felt like this was too hard, or it wasn't for you, etc.
          <br /> <br />
          how about giving it one last shot? not saying it's easy <br />
          but, if you make it, nothing can stop you after this! <br /> <br />
          let this be your best shot ever! you got this!
